A complaint regarding a latent act or omission pertaining to structural defects must be filed within 10 years of the date of the alleged violation.\n\n\n\nThe CSLB also allows consumers to check the status of a contractor's license and order free publications. For any questions concerning the contractor (Sunvalley Solar Inc.), or to file a complaint, please write to: Registrar, Contractors State License Board, Post Office Box 26000, Sacramento, California 95826. The Contractors State License Board may also be reached by phone at 1-800-321-CSLB (2752) or online at http://www.cslb.ca.gov/.\n\n\n\nNotice to Customer Regarding Liens\n\n\n\nUnder the California Mechanic' Lien Law, any contractor, subcontractor, laborer supplier, or other person or entity who helps to improve your property, but is not paid for his or her work or supplies, has a right to place a lien on your home, land , or property where the work was performed and take court action in order to obtain payment.\n\n\n\nThis means that after a court hearing, your home, land, and property could be sold by a court officer and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy what you owe. This can happen even if you have paid your contractor in full if the contractor's subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.\n\n\n\nTo preserve their rights to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or material suppliers are each required to provide you with a document called a \"Preliminary Notice\". Contractor and laborers who contract with customers directly do not have to provide such notice since you are aware of their existence as an customer. A preliminary notice is not a lien against your property. Its purpose is to notify you of persons or entities that may have a right to file a lien against your property if they are not paid. In order to perfect their lien rights, a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, of laborer must file a mechanics' lien with the county recorder which then becomes a recorded lien against your property. Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a mechanics' lien against your property is 90 days after substantial completion of your project.\n\n\n\nNo liens should be applied if the agreed payments are made on time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n-6-\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nSYSTEM PRODUCTION GUARANTEE\n\n\u00a0\n\nSECTION 7.A\n\n\u00a0\n\nLimited Guarantee\n\n\u00a0\n\nSunvalley Solar Inc. hereby guarantees the production of the Photovoltaic System installed by Sunvalley Solar Inc. under the following conditions:\n\n\tThe Photovoltaic System shall produce no less than 92%, under normal working conditions*, of the estimated annual energy production based of 5 years actual production reports.\n\n\tIf however the Photovoltaic System fails to produce at least 92% of the estimated annual energy production, based of 5 years actual production reports under normal working conditions, Sunvalley Solar Inc. shall reimburse the difference in kWh to the owner multiplied by the average utility rate for the annual interval when the Photovoltaic System underperformed.\n\nThe Photovoltaic Systems Production will be monitored and documented by a 3rd Party performance based metering system. The warranted production shall be reviewed and evaluated in one year (365 day) intervals from the date the\n\nsystem is commissioned. All parties shall have access to the present and historical system data via internet and software programs granted through the 3rd party.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Normal working conditions shall be defined as an average of 5.5 hours of sunlight per day, based on a period of 365 days, and with continuous flow of electricity by the utility provider.
