(the “Company”, “Vivint”, “we”, “our”, or “us”, related to the performance of our business, our financial results, our liquidity and capital resources, our plans, strategies and prospects, both business and financial, and other non-historical statements. Forward-looking statements convey the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. All statements contained in this presentation other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. These statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Although we believe that our plans, intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that we will achieve or realize these plans, intentions or expectations. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. These statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “seeks,” “plans,” “scheduled,” “anticipates” or “intends” or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. You should not put undue reliance on these statements which speak only as of this date hereof. You should understand that the following important factors could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements: (1) risks of the smart home and security industry, including risks of and publicity surrounding the sales, subscriber origination and retention process; (2) the highly competitive nature of the smart home and security industry and product introductions and promotional activity by our competitors; (3) litigation, complaints or adverse publicity; (4) the impact of changes in consumer spending patterns, consumer preferences, local, regional, and national economic conditions, crime, weather, demographic trends and employee availability; (5) adverse publicity and product liability claims; (6) increases and/or decreases in utility and other energy costs, increased costs related to utility or governmental requirements; (7) cost increases or shortages in smart home and security technology products or components; (8) the introduction of unsuccessful new SmartHome Services; (9) privacy and data protection laws, privacy or data breaches, or the loss of data; and (10) the impact to our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory compliance and customer experience of the Vivint FlexPay plan and our ability to successfully compete in retail sales channels. In addition, the origination and retention of new subscribers will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, market availability, subscriber interest, the availability of suitable components, the negotiation of acceptable contract terms with subscribers, local permitting, licensing and regulatory compliance, and our ability to manage anticipated expansion and to hire, train and retain personnel, the financial viability of subscribers and general economic conditions. These and other factors that could cause actual results to differ from those implied by the forward-looking statements in this presentation are more fully described in the “Risk Factors” section of our most recent annual report on Form10-K, as such factors may be updated from time to time in our periodic and other filings with the Securities Exchange Commission. These risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive. We disclaim any obligations to and do not intend to update the above list or to announce publicly the results of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements to reflect future events or developments. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements. We undertake no obligations to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 2 



 

 

Non-GAAP financial measures This presentation includes Adjusted EBITDA, which is a supplemental measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as net income (loss) before interest expense (net of interest income), income and franchise taxes and depreciation and amortization (including amortization of capitalized subscriber acquisition costs), further adjusted to exclude the effects of certain contract sales to third parties, non-capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, stock based compensation and certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring and other items permitted in certain covenant calculations under the indentures and other agreements governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about the calculation of, and compliance with, certain covenants in the indentures and other agreements governing our notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. We caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other issuers, because not all issuers and analysts calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Annex A of this presentation for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the Company, which we believe is the most closely comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. 3

Certain Definitions Total subscribers is the aggregate number of active smart home and security subscribers at the end of a given period. This metric excludes subscribers originated under pilot programs. Total monthly service revenue, or MSR, is the contracted recurring monthly service billings to our smart home and security subscribers, based on the Total Subscribers number as of the end of a given period. Total monthly revenue, or Total MR, is the average monthly total revenue recognized during the period. Average monthly revenue per user, or AMRU, is Total MR divided by average monthly Total Subscribers during the period. Average monthly service revenue per user, or AMSRU, is Total MSR divided by Total Subscribers at the end of a given period. Attrition rate is the aggregate number of canceled smart home and security subscribers during the prior 12 month period divided by the monthly weighted average number of Total Subscribers based on the Total Subscribers at the beginning and end of each month of a given period. Subscribers are considered canceled when they terminate in accordance with the terms of their contract, are terminated by us or if payment from such subscribers is deemed uncollectible (when at least four monthly billings become past due). If a sale of a service contract to third parties occurs, or a subscriber relocates but continues their service, we do not consider this as a cancellation. If a subscriber transfers their service contract to a new subscriber, we do not consider this as a cancellation. Net service cost per user is the average monthly service costs incurred during the period (both period and capitalized service costs), including monitoring, customer service, field service and other service support costs, less total non-recurring Smart Home Services billings for the period divided by average monthly Total Subscribers for the same period. Net service margin is the monthly average MSR for the period, less total average net service costs for the period divided by the monthly average MSR for the period. New subscribers is the aggregate number of net new smart home and security subscribers originated during a given period. This metric excludes new subscribers acquired by the transfer of a service contract from one subscriber to another and subscribers originated under pilot programs. Net subscriber acquisition costs per New Subscriber is the direct and indirect costs to create a new smart home and security subscriber divided by New Subscribers for a given 12 month period. These costs include commissions, Products, installation, marketing, sales support and other allocations (general and administrative and overhead); less upfront payment received from the sale of Products associated with the initial installation, and installation fees. These costs exclude capitalized contract costs and upfront proceeds associated with contract modifications.
