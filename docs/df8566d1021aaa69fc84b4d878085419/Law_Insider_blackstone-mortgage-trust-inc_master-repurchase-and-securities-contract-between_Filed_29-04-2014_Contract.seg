comprising real estate to generate operating income sufficient to service the Senior Mortgage Loan (items (a)\u00a0and (b)\u00a0above being, the \u201cPermitted Liens\u201d).

Reservations and Permitted Liens, the Mortgage in respect of each Senior Loan contains valid and enforceable first priority Liens over those items of personal property located on the Underlying Mortgaged Property for such Senior Mortgage Loan that either: (a)\u00a0are reasonably necessary for the Mortgagor in respect of the same to operate such Underlying Mortgaged Property; or (b)\u00a0are (as indicated in the valuation obtained in connection with the origination of such Senior Mortgage Loan material to the value of the Underlying Mortgaged Property (other than any personal property

such Senior Mortgage Loan, each related Underlying Mortgaged Property is, to the Knowledge of Seller, free and clear of any damage that would materially and adversely affect its value as security for such Senior Mortgage Loan (normal wear and tear excepted). \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(b)\n\nSeller has received no notice of any pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened steps to effect the compulsory

on title which showed no adverse entries, or, if such report did reveal any adverse title entry, such title entry would not have caused a reasonably prudent lender of money secured on property similar to the Underlying Mortgaged Property and similarly situated to decline to proceed with the related advance on its agreed terms. \n\n\n\n\n1.12\n\nNo further advances/no partly paid Assets \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(a)\n\nThe proceeds of such Senior Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed and there is no obligation for future advances with respect thereto.

for such purpose that were to have been complied with on or before the Purchase Date for the same have been complied with, or any such funds so escrowed have not been released.

with applicable law, contain customary and enforceable provisions for comparable Underlying Mortgaged Properties similarly situated such as would be expected to render the rights and remedies of the lender thereunder adequate for the practical realisation against the related Underlying Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended to be provided thereby. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(b)\n\nSeller has no Knowledge that the representations and warranties in the Purchased Asset Documents for such Senior Mortgage Loan are not true and correct in all material respects, and Seller is not aware of any adverse change with respect to the such Senior Mortgage Loan, the relevant Mortgagor, the relevant Underlying Mortgaged Property or the owner of the relevant Underlying Mortgaged Property that would render any such representation or warranty not true or correct in any material respect. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(c)\n\nThere is no default or breach existing under the Purchased Asset Documents for such Senior Mortgage Loan and no event has occurred and is continuing which, with the passage of time or giving of notice or both and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a default or breach thereunder, unless any such event, default or breach has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on such Senior Mortgage Loan. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(d)\n\nSeller is not party to any document, instrument or agreement, and there is no document, that by its terms adversely modifies or affects the rights and obligations of any holder of such Senior Mortgage Loan and Seller has not consented to any material change or waiver to any term or provision of any such document, instrument or agreement and no such change or waiver exists. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(e)\n\nThe Purchased Asset Documents for such Senior Mortgage Loan require the related Mortgagor to provide the holder of such Senior Mortgage Loan

Mortgaged Properties. \n\n\n\n\n1.14\n\nSecurity trusts \n\nTo the extent applicable, if any Mortgage or other Lien constituted in the Purchased Asset Documents for such Senior Mortgage Loan is held on trust for the lenders and/or related parties: \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(a)\n\na trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, is properly designated and serving as such; and

related Mortgagor or in connection with any full or partial release of the related Underlying Mortgaged Property or related security for the related Senior Mortgage Loan.

Mortgaged Property comprising real estate in connection with the origination of such Senior Mortgage Loan, and a copy of each such assessment (an \u201cEnvironmental Report\u201d) has been delivered or made available to Buyer. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(b)\n\nTo the Knowledge of Seller, there is no environmental condition or circumstance affecting any such Underlying Mortgaged Property comprising real estate that would have a material adverse effect on the value or marketability of such Underlying Mortgaged Property comprising real estate. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(c)\n\nTo the Knowledge of Seller there is no material outstanding violation of any applicable Environmental Law with respect to any such Underlying Mortgaged Property comprising real estate that would have a material adverse effect on the value or marketability of such Underlying Mortgaged Property comprising real estate. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(d)\n\nEach Mortgage contains customary terms requiring the related Mortgagor to comply with all applicable Environmental Laws. \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n(e)\n\nWhere any such Environmental Report disclosed the existence of a material and adverse environmental condition or circumstance affecting any such Underlying Mortgaged Property comprising real estate: \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(i)\n\nthe related Mortgagor was required either to provide additional security and/or to obtain an operations and maintenance plan; or \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(ii)\n\nthe related Mortgagor provided evidence that applicable Governmental Authorities would not take any action, or require the taking of any action, in respect of such condition or circumstance. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n(f)\n\nThe Purchased Asset Documents for such Senior Mortgage Loan contain provisions pursuant to which the related borrower or a principal of such borrower has agreed to indemnify the mortgagee for damages resulting from violations of any applicable Environmental Laws unless caused by that mortgagee\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct. \n\n\u00a0\n\n1.16\n\nPlanning Law \n\nTo the Knowledge of Seller, there are no material violations of any applicable planning laws or regulations, building codes or land laws applicable to any Underlying Mortgaged Property comprising real estate related to such Senior Mortgage Loan or the use and occupancy thereof which would have a material adverse

or \n\nwhether any power which the Secured Party or the Receiver or administrator is purporting to exercise has become exercisable; or \n\nwhether any money remains due under the Transaction Documents; or \n\nhow any money paid to the Secured Party or to the Receiver or administrator is to be applied. \n\nRedemption of prior mortgages \n\nAt any time after this Security has become enforceable, the Secured Party may: \n\nredeem any prior security interest against any Security Asset; and/or \n\nprocure the transfer of that security interest to itself; and/or \n\nsettle and pass the accounts of the prior mortgagee, chargee or encumbrancer and any accounts so settled and passed shall be conclusive and binding on the Chargor. \n\nAll principal moneys, interest, costs, charges and expenses of and incidental to any such redemption and/or transfer shall be paid by the Chargor to the Secured Party on demand. \n\nThe Chargor must pay to the Secured Party, immediately on demand, the costs and expenses incurred by the Secured Party in connection with any such redemption and/or transfer, including the payment of any principal or interest. \n\nContingencies \n\nIf this Security is enforced at a time when no amount is due under the Transaction Documents but at a time when amounts may or will become due, the Secured Party (or the Receiver) may pay the proceeds of any recoveries effected by it into a suspense account or other account selected by it. \n\nStatutory powers \n\nThe powers conferred by this Deed on the Secured Party or a Receiver are in addition to and not in substitution for the powers conferred on mortgagees and mortgagees in possession under the Act, the Insolvency Act 1986 or otherwise by law and in the case of any conflict between the powers contained in any such Act and those conferred by this Deed, the terms of this Deed will prevail. \n\n\n\n\nAPPOINTMENT AND RIGHTS OF RECEIVERS \n\nAppointment of Receivers \n\nExcept as provided below, the Secured Party may appoint any one or more persons to be a Receiver of all or any part of the Security Assets if this Security has become enforceable. \n\nAny appointment under paragraph (a)\u00a0above may be by deed, under seal or in writing under hand. \n\nExcept as provided below, any restriction imposed by law on the right of a mortgagee to appoint a Receiver (including under section 109(1) of the Act) does not apply to this Deed. \n\nThe Secured Party is not entitled to appoint a Receiver solely as a result of the obtaining of a moratorium (or anything done with a view to obtaining a moratorium) under the Insolvency Act 2000. \n\nThe Secured Party may not appoint an administrative receiver (as defined in section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986) over the Security Assets if the Secured Party is prohibited from so doing by section 72A of the Insolvency Act 1986 and no exception to the prohibition on appointing an administrative receiver applies. \n\nThe Secured Party may by writing under hand (subject to any requirement for an order of the court in the case of an administrative receiver), remove any Receiver appointed by it and may, whenever it thinks fit, appoint a new Receiver in the place of any Receiver whose appointment may for any reason have terminated. \n\nScope of Appointment \n\nAny Receiver may be appointed either Receiver of all the Security Assets or Receiver of such part thereof as may be specified in the appointment and, in the latter case, the rights conferred on a Receiver by this Deed shall have effect as though every reference therein to the Security Assets were a reference to the part of such assets so specified or any part thereof. \n\nRemuneration \n\nThe Secured Party may fix the remuneration of any Receiver appointed by it and the maximum rate specified in Section\u00a0109(6) of the Act will not apply. \n\n\n\n\nAgent of the Chargor \n\nEach Receiver is deemed to be the agent of the Chargor for all purposes and accordingly is deemed to be in the same position as a Receiver duly appointed by a mortgagee under the Act. The Chargor alone shall be responsible for the contracts, engagements, acts, omissions, defaults and losses of a Receiver and for liabilities incurred by a Receiver. The Secured Party shall not incur any liability (either to the Chargor or to any other person) by reason of the appointment of a Receiver or for any other reason. \n\nExercise of Receiver powers by the Secured Party \n\nTo the fullest extent allowed by law, any right, power or discretion conferred by this Deed (either expressly or impliedly) or by law on a Receiver may, after this Security becomes enforceable, be exercised by the Secured Party in relation to any Security Asset without first appointing a Receiver and notwithstanding the appointment of a Receiver. \n\nPOWERS OF RECEIVERS \n\nGeneral \n\nA Receiver has all of the rights, powers and discretions set out below in this Clause in addition to those conferred on it by any law and this includes: \n\nin the case of an administrative receiver, all the rights powers and discretions conferred on an administrative receiver under the Insolvency Act, 1986; and \n\notherwise, all the rights, powers and discretions conferred on a receiver (or a receiver and manager) under the Act and the Insolvency Act, 1986. \n\nIf there is more than one Receiver holding office at the same time, each Receiver may (unless the document appointing him states otherwise) exercise all of the powers conferred on a Receiver under this Deed individually and to the exclusion of any other Receiver. \n\nRights of Receivers \n\nAny Receiver appointed pursuant to this Deed shall be entitled (either in his or her own name or in the name of the Chargor or any trustee or nominee for the Chargor) and in any manner and upon such terms and conditions as the Receiver thinks fit: \n\nto collect any amounts due under any Security Asset; \n\nto carry on any business relating to the Security Assets; \n\nto settle, adjust, refer to arbitration, compromise and arrange any claims, accounts, disputes, questions and demands with or by any person who is or claims to be a creditor of the Chargor or relating in any way any Security Asset; \n\n\n\n\nto bring, prosecute, enforce, defend and abandon actions, suits and proceedings in relation to any Security Asset which the Receiver thinks fit; \n\nto appoint and discharge officers, managers, employees, agents and advisors of all kinds for the purposes of this Deed upon such terms as to remuneration or otherwise as the Receiver sees fit and to discharge any person appointed by the Chargor in relation to the Security Assets; \n\nto sell, exchange, convert into money and realise any Security Asset by public auction or privately and for which purposes the consideration for the relevant transaction may consist of cash, debentures or other obligations, shares, stock or other valuable consideration and any such consideration may be payable in a lump sum or by instalments spread over any period the Receiver thinks fit; \n\nto give a valid receipt for any moneys and execute any assurance or thing which may be proper or desirable for realising any Security Asset; and \n\nto otherwise: \n\ndo all such other acts and things the Receiver may consider necessary or expedient for the realising of any Security Asset or incidental or conducive to the exercise of any of the rights conferred on the Receiver under or by virtue of this Deed or law; \n\nexercise in relation to any Security Assets all the powers, authorities and things which the Receiver would be capable of exercising if the Receiver were the absolute beneficial owner of that Security Asset; and \n\nuse the name of the Chargor for any of the above purposes. \n\nEach of the rights specified in each of the above paragraphs shall (except as otherwise provided) be distinct and shall not be in any way limited by reference to any other paragraph. \n\nDelegation \n\nA Receiver may delegate his powers in accordance with this Deed. \n\nAPPLICATION OF PROCEEDS \n\nAny moneys received by the Secured Party or any Receiver after this Security has become enforceable shall be applied: \n\nin or towards payment of or provision for all costs and expenses incurred by the Secured Party or any Receiver under or in connection with this Deed and of all remuneration due to any Receiver under or in connection with this Deed; \n\nin or towards payment of or provision for the Secured Liabilities; and \n\n\n\n\nin payment of the surplus (if any) to the Chargor or other person entitled to it. \n\nThis Clause is subject to the payment of any claims having priority over this Security. This Clause does not prejudice the right of any Finance Party to recover any shortfall from the Chargor. \n\nDELEGATION \n\nThe Secured Party and any Receiver may delegate by power of attorney or in any other manner to any person any right, power or discretion exercisable by it under this Deed. Any such delegation may be made upon the terms (including power to sub-delegate) which the Secured Party or Receiver may think fit. Neither the Secured Party nor any Receiver will be in any way liable or responsible to the Chargor for any loss or liability arising from any act, default, omission or misconduct on the part of any such delegate or sub-delegate (except any loss or liability resulting from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of any such delegate or sub-delegate). \n\nEXPENSES AND INDEMNITY \n\nThe Chargor must: \n\npromptly on demand pay all actual out of pocket costs and expenses (including legal fees properly incurred) incurred in connection with the enforcement by the Secured Party of the Secured Party\u2019s rights under this Deed, by the Secured Party, a Receiver, any attorney, manager, agent or other person appointed by the Secured Party under this Deed; and \n\nkeep each of them indemnified against any failure or delay in paying those costs or expenses. \n\nFURTHER ASSURANCES \n\nThe Chargor must, at its own expense, take whatever action the Secured Party or a Receiver may reasonably require for: \n\ncreating, perfecting or protecting any Security intended to be created by this Deed; or \n\nfacilitating (once this Security has become enforceable) the realisation of any Security Asset, or the exercise of any right, power or discretion exercisable, by the Secured Party or any Receiver or any of its delegates or sub-delegates in respect of any Security Asset. \n\nThis includes: \n\nthe execution of any transfer, conveyance, assignment or assurance of any property, whether to the Secured Party or to its nominee; or \n\n\n\n\nthe giving of any notice, order or direction and the making of any registration, \n\nwhich, in any such case, the Secured Party may think expedient (acting reasonably). \n\nPOWER OF ATTORNEY \n\nThe Chargor by way of security irrevocably and severally appoints the Secured Party, each Receiver and any of their respective delegates or sub-delegates to be its attorney and in its name and on its behalf to take any action which the Chargor is obliged to take under this Deed and has failed to take following written request by the Secured Party. The Chargor ratifies and confirms whatever any attorney does or purports to do under its appointment under this Clause. \n\nAPPROPRIATION \n\nTo the extent that any of the Security Assets constitute \u201cfinancial collateral\u201d and this Deed and the obligations of the Chargor under this Deed constitute a \u201csecurity financial collateral arrangement\u201d (as defined in and for the purposes of the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No.2) Regulations 2003 (the \u201cRegulations\u201d)), at any time after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Secured Party may appropriate all or part of the Security Assets in or towards satisfaction of the Secured Liabilities. \n\nThe Secured Party must attribute a value to the appropriated Security Asset in a commercially reasonable manner. \n\nWhere the Secured Party exercises its rights of appropriation and the value of the Security Assets appropriated differs from the amount of the Secured Liabilities, as the case may be, either: \n\nthe Secured Party must account to the Chargor for the amount by which the value of the Security Assets exceeds the Secured Liabilities; or \n\nthe Chargor will remain liable to the Secured Party for any amount whereby the value of the Security Assets are less than the Secured Liabilities. \n\nRELEASE \n\nAt the end of the Security Period, the Secured Party must, at the request and cost of the Chargor, take whatever action is necessary to release the Security Assets from this Security. \n\nGOVERNING LAW \n\nThis Deed and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by English law. \n\n\n\n\nENFORCEMENT \n\nJurisdiction \n\nIn this Clause \u201cDispute\u201d means any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Deed (including a dispute relating to the existence, validity or termination of this Deed) or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with this Deed. \n\nThe Parties submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England for the purpose of any Dispute. \n\nEach Party waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, any defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of proceeding in relation to a Dispute in any of the courts referred to in paragraph (b)\u00a0above and any right of jurisdiction on account of its place of residence or domicile. \n\nService of process \n\nWithout prejudice to any other mode of service allowed under any relevant law, the Chargor: \n\nirrevocably appoints [\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0] having its address at [\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0] as its agent for service of process in relation to any proceedings before the English courts in connection with any Transaction Document; and \n\nagrees that failure by a process agent to notify the Chargor of the process will not invalidate the proceedings concerned. \n\nIf any person appointed as an agent for service of process is unable for any reason to act as agent for service of process, the Chargor must immediately (and in any event within 5 Business Days of such event) appoint another agent on terms acceptable to the Secured Party, failing which the Secured Party may appoint another agent for this purpose. \n\nThis Deed has been entered into as a deed on the date stated at the beginning of this Deed. \n\n\n\n\nSchedule \n\nForm of Notice and Acknowledgement \n\nPart 1 \n\nForm of Notice to Borrower \n\n\u00a0\n\nTo:\n\n[Borrower] \n\n[Date] \n\nDear Sirs, \n\nThis letter constitutes notice to you that (i)\u00a0by a Security Deed dated [\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0], 20[\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0] (the \u201cSecurity Deed\u201d) we have assigned by way of security and (ii)\u00a0by the Master Repurchase Agreement (as defined in the Security Deed) we have assigned, to Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.

In consideration of the mutual promises set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Seller, Buyer and Ropes\u00a0& Gray LLP (the \u201cBailee\u201d) hereby agree as follows: \n\n(a) Seller shall deliver to the Bailee in connection with any Purchased Assets delivered to the Bailee hereunder, the Custodial Delivery Certificate attached hereto as Attachment 1. \n\n(b) On or prior to the date indicated on the Custodial Delivery Certificate delivered by Seller (the \u201cFunding Date\u201d), Seller shall have delivered to the Bailee, as bailee for hire, the original documents set forth on Exhibit B to Attachment 1 attached thereto (collectively, the \u201cPurchased Asset File\u201d) for each of the Purchased Assets (each a \u201cPurchased Asset\u201d and collectively, the \u201cPurchased Assets\u201d) listed in Exhibit A to Attachment 1 attached thereto. \n\n(c) The Bailee shall issue and deliver to Buyer and U.S. Bank National Association (the \u201cCustodian\u201d) on or prior to the Funding Date by electronic mail (a)\u00a0in the name of Buyer, an initial trust receipt and certification in the form of \n\n\n\n\nAttachment 2 attached hereto (the \u201cBailee\u2019s Trust Receipt and Certification\u201d) which Bailee\u2019s Trust Receipt and Certification shall state that the Bailee has received the documents comprising the Purchased Asset File as set forth in the Custodial Delivery Certificate. \n\n(d) On the applicable Funding Date, in the event that Buyer fails to purchase from Seller the Purchased Assets identified in the related Custodial Delivery Certificate, Buyer shall deliver by electronic mail to the Bailee to the attention of David C.

\n\nall of its rights under each Finance Document against each Finance Party (including without limitation the Agent and the Security Trustee in relation to any asset or right held by either of them as agent or trustee for the Finance Parties); \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n1\u00a0\n\nAll the capitalized terms in this section require confirmation of such term in the Facilities Agreement. \n\n\n\n\nits interest as beneficiary under each trust of Security Property or other asset constituted by or under any Finance Document; \n\nall of its rights against the provider of any technical or legal or other professional report delivered to any of the Finance Parties under the Facility Agreement; and \n\nall of its rights against any professional advisors engaged by or on behalf of the Finance Parties in connection with the Facility Agreement. \n\nThe Chargor charges by way of first fixed charge each of the rights and interests referred to in paragraph (a)\u00a0to the extent that those rights or interests are not effectively assigned to the Secured Party under paragraph (a). \n\nREPRESENTATIONS \u2013 GENERAL \n\nNature of security \n\nThe Chargor represents to the Secured Party that, to the extent that its interest in the Security Assets have not already been transferred to the Secured Party, this Deed creates those security interests it purports to create and is not liable to be avoided or otherwise set aside on the liquidation or administration of the Chargor or otherwise. \n\nTimes for making representations \n\nThe representations set out in this Deed are made on the date of this Deed. \n\nUnless a representation is expressed to be given at a specific date, each representation under this Deed is deemed to be repeated by the Chargor on the Purchase Date. \n\nWhen a representation is repeated, it is applied to the circumstances existing at the time of repetition. \n\nRESTRICTIONS ON DEALINGS \n\nSecurity \n\nExcept as expressly allowed in the Master Repurchase Agreement, the Chargor must not create or permit to subsist any security interest on any Security Asset (except for this Security). \n\nDisposals \n\nExcept as expressly allowed in the Master Repurchase Agreement, the Chargor must not sell, transfer, licence, lease or otherwise dispose of any Security Asset. \n\n\n\n\nNOTICES \n\nNotices of assignment \n\nThe Chargor must on the date hereof serve a notice, substantially in the form of Part 1 of the Schedule, on each Borrower and use reasonable endeavours to ensure that each Borrower acknowledges that notice, substantially in the form of Part 2 of the Schedule. \n\nWHEN SECURITY BECOMES ENFORCEABLE \n\nThis Security shall become immediately enforceable if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing. \n\nAfter this Security has become enforceable, the Secured Party may in its absolute discretion and without notice to the Chargor enforce all or any part of this Security in any manner it sees fit. \n\nENFORCEMENT OF SECURITY \n\nGeneral \n\nThe statutory power of sale and the other statutory powers conferred on mortgagees by Section\u00a0101 of the Act as varied and extended by this Deed will be immediately exercisable at any time after this Security has become enforceable. \n\nSection\u00a0103 of the Act (restricting the power of sale) and Section\u00a093 of the Act (restricting the right of consolidation) do not apply to this Security. \n\nFor the purposes of all powers implied by statute, the Secured Liabilities are deemed to have become due and payable on the date of this Deed. \n\nNo liability as mortgagee in possession \n\nNeither the Secured Party nor any Receiver nor any administrator will be liable, by reason of entering into possession of a Security Asset, to account as mortgagee in possession or for any loss on realisation or for any default or omission for which a mortgagee in possession might be liable except to the extent caused by its or his own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. \n\nPrivileges \n\nEach Receiver and the Secured Party is entitled to all the rights, powers, privileges and immunities conferred by the Act on mortgagees and receivers when such receivers have been duly appointed under the Act, except that Section\u00a0103 of the Act does not apply. \n\n\n\n\nProtection of third parties \n\nNo person (including a purchaser) dealing with the Secured Party or a Receiver or an administrator or its or his agents will be concerned to enquire: \n\nwhether the Secured Liabilities have become payable; or \n\nwhether any power which the Secured Party or the Receiver or administrator is purporting to exercise has become exercisable; or \n\nwhether any money remains due under the Transaction Documents; or \n\nhow any money paid to the Secured Party or to the Receiver or administrator is to be applied. \n\nRedemption of prior mortgages \n\nAt any time after this Security has become enforceable, the Secured Party may: \n\nredeem any prior security interest against any Security Asset; and/or \n\nprocure the transfer of that security interest to itself; and/or \n\nsettle and pass the accounts of the prior mortgagee, chargee or encumbrancer and any accounts so settled and passed shall be conclusive and binding on the Chargor. \n\nAll principal moneys, interest, costs, charges and expenses of and incidental to any such redemption and/or transfer shall be paid by the Chargor to the Secured Party on demand. \n\nThe Chargor must pay to the Secured Party, immediately on demand, the costs and expenses incurred by the Secured Party in connection with any such redemption and/or transfer, including the payment of any principal or interest. \n\nContingencies \n\nIf this Security is enforced at a time when no amount is due under the Transaction Documents but at a time when amounts may or will become due, the Secured Party (or the Receiver) may pay the proceeds of any recoveries effected by it into a suspense account or other account selected by it. \n\nStatutory powers \n\nThe powers conferred by this Deed on the Secured Party or a Receiver are in addition to and not in substitution for the powers conferred on mortgagees and mortgagees in possession under the Act, the Insolvency Act 1986 or otherwise by law and in the case of any conflict between the powers contained in any such Act and those conferred by this Deed, the terms of this Deed will prevail. \n\n\n\n\nAPPOINTMENT AND RIGHTS OF RECEIVERS \n\nAppointment of Receivers \n\nExcept as provided below, the Secured Party may appoint any one or more persons to be a Receiver of all or any part of the Security Assets if this Security has become enforceable. \n\nAny appointment under paragraph (a)\u00a0above may be by deed, under seal or in writing under hand. \n\nExcept as provided below, any restriction imposed by law on the right of a mortgagee to appoint a Receiver (including under section 109(1) of the Act) does not apply to this Deed. \n\nThe Secured Party is not entitled to appoint a Receiver solely as a result of the obtaining of a moratorium (or anything done with a view to obtaining a moratorium) under the Insolvency Act 2000. \n\nThe Secured Party may not appoint an administrative receiver (as defined in section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986) over the Security Assets if the Secured Party is prohibited from so doing by section 72A of the Insolvency Act 1986 and no exception to the prohibition on appointing an administrative receiver applies. \n\nThe Secured Party may by writing under hand (subject to any requirement for an order of the court in the case of an administrative receiver), remove any Receiver appointed by it and may, whenever it thinks fit, appoint a new Receiver in the place of any Receiver whose appointment may for any reason have terminated. \n\nScope of Appointment \n\nAny Receiver may be appointed either Receiver of all the Security Assets or Receiver of such part thereof as may be specified in the appointment and, in the latter case, the rights conferred on a Receiver by this Deed shall have effect as though every reference therein to the Security Assets were a reference to the part of such assets so specified or any part thereof. \n\nRemuneration \n\nThe Secured Party may fix the remuneration of any Receiver appointed by it and the maximum rate specified in Section\u00a0109(6) of the Act will not apply. \n\n\n\n\nAgent of the Chargor \n\nEach Receiver is deemed to be the agent of the Chargor for all purposes and accordingly is deemed to be in the same position as a Receiver duly appointed by a mortgagee under the Act. The Chargor alone shall be responsible for the contracts, engagements, acts, omissions, defaults and losses of a Receiver and for liabilities incurred by a Receiver. The Secured Party shall not incur any liability (either to the Chargor or to any other person) by reason of the appointment of a Receiver or for any other reason. \n\nExercise of Receiver powers by the Secured Party \n\nTo the fullest extent allowed by law, any right, power or discretion conferred by this Deed (either expressly or impliedly) or by law on a Receiver may, after this Security becomes enforceable, be exercised by the Secured Party in relation to any Security Asset without first appointing a Receiver and notwithstanding the appointment of a Receiver. \n\nPOWERS OF RECEIVERS \n\nGeneral \n\nA Receiver has all of the rights, powers and discretions set out below in this Clause in addition to those conferred on it by any law and this includes: \n\nin the case of an administrative receiver, all the rights powers and discretions conferred on an administrative receiver under the Insolvency Act, 1986; and \n\notherwise, all the rights, powers and discretions conferred on a receiver (or a receiver and manager) under the Act and the Insolvency Act, 1986. \n\nIf there is more than one Receiver holding office at the same time, each Receiver may (unless the document appointing him states otherwise) exercise all of the powers conferred on a Receiver under this Deed individually and to the exclusion of any other Receiver. \n\nRights of Receivers \n"
