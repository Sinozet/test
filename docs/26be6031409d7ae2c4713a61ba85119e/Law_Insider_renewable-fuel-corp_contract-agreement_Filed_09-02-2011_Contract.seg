The replacement shall be appointed in the same manner as the replaced person was required to have been nominated or agreed upon, as described in this Sub-Clause.\n\n\n\nThe appointment of any member may be terminated by mutual agreement of both Parties, but not by the Contract Awarder or the Contractor acting alone. Unless otherwise agreed by both Parties, the appointment of the DAB (including each member) shall expire when the DAB has given its decision on the dispute referred to it under Sub-Clause 20.4, unless other disputes have been referred to the DAB by that time under Sub-Clause 20.4, in which event the relevant date shall be when the DAB has also given decisions on those disputes.\n\n\n\n\n\n20.3\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Failure to Agree Dispute Adjudication Board\n\n\n\nIf any of the following conditions apply, namely:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n(a)\n\nthe Parties fail to agree upon the appointment of the sole member of the DAB by the date stated in the first paragraph of Sub-Clause 20.2 [Appointment of the Dispute Adjudication Board),\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n(b)\n\neither Party fails to nominate a member (for approval by the other Party) of a DAB of three persons by such date,\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n(c)\n\nthe Parties fail to agree upon the appointment of the third member (to act as chairman) of the DAB by such date, or\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n(d)\n\nthe Parties fail to agree upon the appointment of a replacement person within 42 days after the date on which the sole member or one of the three members declines to act or is unable to act as a result of death, disability, resignation or termination of appointment,\n\n\n\nthen the appointing entity or official named in the Contract Agreement shall, upon the request of either or both of the Parties and after due consultation with both Parties, appoint this member of the DAB.

Such reference shall state that it is given under this Sub-Clause.\n\n\n\nFor a DAB of three persons, the DAB shall be deemed to have received such reference on the date when it is received by the chairman of the DAB.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\n\nBoth Parties shall promptly make available to the DAB all information, access to the Work Site, and appropriate facilities, as the DAB may require for the purposes of making a decision on such dispute. The DAB shall be deemed to be not acting as arbitrator(s).\n\n\n\nWithin 84 days after receiving such reference, or the advance payment referred to in Clause 6 of the Appendix - General Conditions of the Dispute Adjudication Agreement, whichever date is later, or within such other period as may be proposed by the DAB and approved by both Parties, the DAB shall give its decision, which shall be reasoned and shall state that it is given under this Sub-Clause. However, if neither of the Parties has paid in full the invoices submitted by each Member pursuant to Clause 6 of the Appendix, the DAB shall not be obliged to give its decision until such invoices have been paid in full. The decision shall be binding on both Parties, who shall promptly give effect to it unless and until it shall be revised in an amicable settlement or an arbitral award as described below. Unless the Contract has already been abandoned, repudiated or terminated, the Contractor shall continue to proceed with the Works in accordance with the Contract.\n\n\n\nIf either Party is dissatisfied with the DAB's decision, then either Party may, within 28 days after receiving the decision, give notice to the other Party of its dissatisfaction. If the DAB fails to give its decision within the period of 84 days (or as otherwise approved) after receiving such reference or such payment, then either Party may, within 28 days after this period has expired, give notice to the other Party of its dissatisfaction.\n\n\n\nIn either event, this notice of dissatisfaction shall state that it is given under this Sub-Clause, and shall set out the matter in dispute and the reason(s) for dissatisfaction. Except as stated in SubClause 20.7 [Failure to Comply with Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision] and Sub-Clause 20.8 [Expiry of Dispute Adjudication Board's Appointment], neither Party shall be entitled to commence arbitration of a dispute unless a notice of dissatisfaction has been given in accordance with this Sub-Clause.\n\n\n\nIf the DAB has given its decision as to a matter in dispute to both Parties, and no notice of dissatisfaction has been given by either Party within 28 days after it received the DAB's decision, then the decision shall become final and binding upon both Parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n20.5\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amicable Settlement\n\n\n\nWhere notice of dissatisfaction has been given under Sub-Clause 20.4 above, both Parties shall attempt to settle the dispute amicably before the commencement of arbitration. However, unless both Parties agree otherwise, arbitration may be commenced on or after the fifty-sixth day after the day on which notice of dissatisfaction was given, even if no attempt at amicable settlement has been made.\n\n\n\n\n\n20.6\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arbitration\n\n\n\nUnless settled amicably, any dispute in respect of which the DAB's decision (if any) has not become final and binding shall be finally settled by international arbitration.

Any decision of the DAB shall be admissible in evidence in the arbitration.\n\n\n\nArbitration may be commenced prior to or after completion of the Works. The obligations of the Parties and the DAB shall not be altered by reason of any arbitration being conducted during the progress of the Works.\n\n\n\n\n\n20.7\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Failure to Comply with Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision\n\n\n\nIn the event that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n(a)\n\nneither Party has given notice of dissatisfaction within the period stated in Sub-Clause 20.4 [Obtaining Dispute Adjudication Board's Decision],\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n(b)\n\nthe DAB's related decision (if any) has become final and binding, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n(c)\n\na Party fails to comply with this decision,\n\n\n\nthen the other Party may, without prejudice to any other rights it may have, refer the failure itself to arbitration under Sub-Clause 20.6 [Arbitration].
