For a period of [*] following ZAI\u2019s receipt of an Option Notice, TESARO and ZAI will negotiate in good faith commercially reasonable terms for the foregoing license of the applicable Immuno-Oncology Asset to TESARO. If TESARO does not deliver an Option Notice to ZAI within the applicable [*] period, or declines in writing its option to take a license to the applicable Immuno-Oncology Asset after review of the Transaction Notice, then TESARO shall be deemed to have waived its rights under this Section\u00a08.1(b) solely with respect to the applicable Immuno-Oncology Asset, and ZAI will be free to enter into a license for such Immuno-Oncology Asset with any Third Party thereafter. If TESARO exercises its option by providing the Option Notice with respect to the applicable Immuno-Oncology Asset, but TESARO and ZAI do not mutually agree on the terms of a license to TESARO within the [*] negotiation period described above, ZAI may not enter into any license transaction for such Immuno-Oncology Asset outside of the ZAI Territory with any Third Party for a period of [*] following the end of such [*] negotiation period (the \u201cRestricted Period\u201d).
