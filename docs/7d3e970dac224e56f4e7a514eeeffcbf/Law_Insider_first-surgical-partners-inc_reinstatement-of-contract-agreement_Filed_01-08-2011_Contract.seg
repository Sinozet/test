            "Re: Grant of Exclusive Agency Agreement Dear Jacob:\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis letter is written to evidence the appointment of Vital Weight Control, Inc. (\"Vital\") as exclusive agent for negotiating emergency facilities management services agreements on behalf of First Street Hospital, L.P. (\"First Street\"). For and in consideration of the execution by Vital of that certain Reinstatement of Contract Agreement, dated of even date herewith and executed contemporaneously herewith, Vital and First Street agree as follows:",
            "1.\u00a0\n\nFirst Street agrees to appoint and by this letter of agreement (\"Agreement\") does appoint Vital as its sole and exclusive agent to negotiate, on behalf of First Street, emergency facilities management services agreements for free-standing emergency care centers (collectively, \"Services Agreements\"; individually, a \"Services Agreement\") with respect to the operation or management of any free standing emergency services with various third parties in the emergency medical services business, upon substantially similar terms to those contained in the Amended and Restated Facilities Management Services Agreement set forth in Exhibit \"A\" attached hereto and incorporated herewith for all relevant purposes (herein referred to as the \"Facilities Management Services Agreement\").",
            "2.\u00a0\n\nFirst Street agrees that so long as the basic provisions of the contracts tendered by Vital are the same or substantially the same as those of the Facilities Management Services Agreement that it will act in good faith to timely (within 30 days) review and enter into such tendered contracts. Notwithstanding the above, while the Facilities Management Services Agreement provides for a one year term, First Street agrees that a three year minimum term with no termination during the term by First Street for any reason other than a material breach by the third party emergency services provider will be acceptable for any Services Agreements tendered by Vital. Additionally, First Street agrees that the only qualification required of an emergency medical services provider for consideration of a tendered Services Agreement by First Street is for the emergency medical services provider to be currently operating one or more free standing (not within the four walls of a hospital) emergency facility.",
            "3.\u00a0\n\nVital shall have the right to negotiate Services Agreements with third parties to provide emergency services for First Street at rates that are more lucrative than the rate of 4% of collections provided in the Facilities Management Services Agreement. It is agreed and understood that Vital shall be entitled to receive as payment for services rendered to First Street any difference between 4% of collections paid to First Street and the percentage that is set forth in the negotiated Services Agreement (such difference, the \"Spread\"). For example, if Vital negotiates a Services Agreement providing for 6% of collections and First Street enters into such Services Agreement, then Vital shall receive the 2% difference of collections.",
            "2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nA \"Material Breach\" shall exist hereunder if First Street shall (i) fail to act in good faith to enter into any Services Agreements tendered by Vital to First Street, or (ii) fail to comply with the payment provisions set forth in paragraph 3 above, and any such failure is not remedied by First Street within 10 days of receipt of written notice from Vital. The parties agree that it would be difficult to determine the actual extent of damages suffered by Vital in the event a Material Breach shall occur. In the event a Material Breach shall occur, First Street shall pay liquidated damages to Vital calculated as follows: (a) for a Material Breach occurring during the initial 12 months of a Services Agreement, liquidated damages shall be equal to the Spread for such particular Services Agreement, multiplied by $500,000.00, and multiplied by the number of months remaining under such Services Agreement, or (b) for a Material Breach occurring after the initial 12 months of the Services Agreement, liquidated damages shall be equal to the Spread for such particular Services Agreement, multiplied by the greater of the estimated average monthly collections for the twelve month period (or actual portion thereof) and $500,000.00, and multiplied by the number of months remaining under such Services Agreement. The parties agree that such amount of liquidated damages is fair and reasonable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of a Material Breach, Vital will also be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's and experts' fees and expenses and any other cost of litigation.",
            "5.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAs exclusive agent, the parties intend that Vital shall be the sole and only party that may tender Services Agreements to First Street for consideration and execution. It is the parties' intention that this exclusive agency shall exclude all other persons or entities, including but not limited to directors, officers, employees and principals of First Street, from tendering or negotiating any Services Agreement. Should First Street, or its general partner, or the managers of its general partner, own or operate during the term of this Agreement an emergency room facility that is not a physical part of a licensed hospital, then this grant of an exclusive agency shall apply to negotiations of Services Agreements with the facility or facilities. Furthermore, should the general partner of First Street or the general partner's managers, own, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, a licensed hospital within 50 miles of the Houston Metropolitan area, then this right of exclusive agency shall apply to negotiations of a Services Agreement for such licensed hospital.",
            "6.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis exclusive agency agreement shall last for a term of three years and shall apply to any and all Services Agreements tendered by Vital to First Street and entered into by First Street during such three year period, including any and all extensions or renewals of the Services Agreements. Furthermore, First Street agrees to pay an additional amount equal to 18% of any sum that it wrongfully withholds and fails to pay within 10 days of First Street's receipt of the insurance company's explanation of benefits (\"EOB\") as a late payment fee. Vital shall have the right to assign this Agreement to any entity owned either by Vital or by any principal of Vital.",
            "7.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis Agreement shall be construed and governed by the laws of the State of Texas. In the event that any provision is rendered invalid or unenforceable by the enactment of any applicable statute or ordinance or by any regulation duly promulgated or is made or declared unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The parties agree that venue for any proceeding arising hereunder shall lie exclusively in Harris County, Texas.",
            "Initial: JV\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n8.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThe parties agree to submit any dispute arising under this Agreement to voluntary mediation before a mediator to be mutually acceptable to both parties. The parties shall share equally in the cost of the mediator and each party shall incur the cost of its own legal representation. In the event the dispute is not resolved through mediation, the parties agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration before a mutually acceptable arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Unless otherwise ordered by the arbitrator, the parties shall share equally in the cost of the arbitration and each party shall incur the cost of its own legal representation. Judgment upon any award rendered by an arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.",
            "9.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nTime is of the essence with respect to the performance of every provision of this Agreement in which time or performance is a factor.",
            "10.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nAny notices required to be given under the terms of this Agreement shall be given either in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested to the applicable party at the address set forth in the signature blocks at the end of this Agreement. Either party, by notice to the other given in the aforesaid manner, may specify a different address or agent for notice purposes.",
            "11.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nThis Agreement supercedes any and all other agreements, whether oral or written between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Facsimile signatures shall be binding and enforceable.",
