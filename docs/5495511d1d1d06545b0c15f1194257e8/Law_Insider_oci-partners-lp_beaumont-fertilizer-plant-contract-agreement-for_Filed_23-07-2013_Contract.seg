Constructor shall provide reasonable assistance to Owner in pursuing such remedies and claims.",
            "3.9.4 Subject to the limitations of liability and remedies set forth in the Agreement, the Constructor\u2019s obligations and liability, if any, with respect to any Defective Work discovered after the one-year correction period (latent defects) shall be determined by the Law.

In such case, monies due to Constructor shall be equitably adjusted for any diminution in the value of the Project caused by such Defective Work only if it was proven that such Defective Work was not requested for inspection by the Constructor per the requirements of Section\u00a03.7 above.",
            "3.9.8 he Owner selected and approved all Subcontractors and Material Suppliers, and specified all Work and Materials. In no event shall Constructor\u2019s liability for defects in the Work and Materials be greater than the warranties and corrective work provided and performed by the applicable Subcontractors and Material Suppliers. For the avoidance of doubt, Owner shall look solely to the Subcontractors and Material Suppliers for all defective or otherwise nonconforming Work and Materials and any recovery of costs incurred by the Owner for performing corrective work.",
