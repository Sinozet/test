(With payments to be made as follows; payments shall be made by cash or check):



Lump Sum Payment

(Within 5 business days after the customer receives the cash grant from the U.S. Treasury Department.  The payment shall be the exact amount of cash grant)



Monthly Payment A

$318,220.32

(After the customer receives the monthly incentive from Imperial Irrigation District utility company, the customer will pay such exact incentive amount to Sunvalley within 5 business days.  The incentive paid by the utility company will be based on the actual production of the installed system, the customer will not be responsible for the differences between the total actual incentive payments and the total estimated payments as stated above)

The first instalment is due within 5 days following the photovoltaic system inspection and approval by the City Administrator and Utility Company.



Following the first instalment, Sunvalley is to send statements for monthly payment (less the first payment) to the customer. Our payment structure is based upon the premise that all statements are due and payable upon receipt, but in any event, no later than ten (10) days from the date of the statement. Sunvalley reserves the right to charge a monthly late payment fee, at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum, from the due date for payment until receipt by the Sunvalley of the full amount.



Sunvalley like other businesses has substantial cash demands that require Sunvalley to borrow money if its accounts are not paid promptly. Thus, a finance charge at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum of the unpaid balance, computed from date of the last invoice until paid will be added to any delinquent accounts. In the event that an account becomes delinquent, Sunvailey employs the same prudent collection procedures used by other businesses, including but not limited to third-party debt collection and legal action.

NOTICE TO CUSTOMER REGARDING COMPLAINTS

For any questions concerning the contractor (Sunvalley Solar Inc.), or to file a complaint, please write to: Registrar, Contractors State License Board, Post Office Box 26000, Sacramento, California 95826.

Notice to Customer Regarding Liens



Under the California Mechanic' Lien Law, any contractor, subcontractor, laborer supplier, or other person or entity who helps to improve your property, but is not paid for his or her work or supplies, has a right to place a lien on your home, land , or property where the work was performed and take court action in order to obtain payment.



This means that after a court hearing, your home, land, and property could be sold by a court officer and the proceeds of the sale used to satisfy what you owe. This can happen even if you have paid your contractor in full if the contractor's subcontractors, laborers, or suppliers remain unpaid.



To preserve their rights to file a claim or lien against your property, certain claimants such as subcontractors or material suppliers are each required to provide you with a document called a "Preliminary Notice". Contractor and laborers who contract with customers directly do not have to provide such notice since you are aware of their existence as an customer. A preliminary notice is not a lien against your property. Its purpose is to notify you of persons or entities that may have a right to file a lien against your property if they are not paid. In order to perfect their lien rights, a contractor, subcontractor, supplier, of laborer must file a mechanics' lien with the county recorder which then becomes a recorded lien against your property. Generally, the maximum time allowed for filing a mechanics' lien against your property is 90 days after substantial completion of your project.



No liens should be applied if the agreed payments are made on time.
