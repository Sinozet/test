A \"Dispute\" includes any action, claim, or controversy of any kind, whether based upon contract, tort, statutory or common law, equity, or otherwise, that in any way pertains to the Contract to which this Addendum is attached, any Work performed pursuant to this Agreement or any related agreements, papers, documents, or instruments (the \"Agreements\").\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis arbitration shall be governed by a three (3) arbitrator panel.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEach party shall, in good faith, appoint an arbitrator within ten (10) days after receipt of a written demand for\n\narbitration. Those two preferred arbitrators will then meet, confer, and appoint a separate individual to serve as the third arbitrator. Any arbitrator appointed shall be either a former judge of the Superior Court or higher court in Arizona, or a practicing attorney with at least 10years experience in real estate law in the State of Arizona. The fees of the arbitrators (including administrative fees, costs, and arbitrator compensation) shall initially be paid and shared equally (112 and 112) between the parties, but the prevailing party shall be awarded its share of the arbitrators' fees against the other party.

Each disclosure statement shall be made in writing, under oath, signed by the party making the disclosure, and delivered to the other party. All disclosure statements shall be exchanged, and all discovery completed, at least 15days prior to the arbitration hearing. Before my arbitration takes place, the parties agree that upon the request of either party, they will have the arbitrators conduct a \"preliminary\" hearing (i.e., a separate proceeding prior to the actual arbitration), at which evidence and testimony may be presented and legal briefs may be submitted, including briefs setting forth the applicable statutory or common law methods of measuring damages pertaining to the Dispute. The arbitrators may grant summary judgment if they determine no issue of fact exists as to a claim.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo the extent not decided by summary judgment, the Dispute shall be heard within 60 days after the parties select the arbitrators. The arbitrators shall render their decision in writing, specifying the factual and legal basis for the decision, within\n\nthirty (30) days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing.

All statutes of limitation applicable to any Dispute shall apply to any proceeding in accordance with this Arbitration Addendum. Except as provided below, the decision of the arbitrators shall be final and binding upon all parties. Judgment to enforce the arbitrators' decision, whether for legal or equitable relief, may be entered in the Superior Court of Maricopa County, Arizona, and the parties hereto expressly and irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such Court for such purpose. For purposes of this Agreement and Arbitration Addendum, a complaining party is considered the prevailing party should complainant recover seventy-five percent (75%) or more of the amount in damages claimed, exclusive of any attorneys' fees and arbitration costs that may be awarded as provided for in this Addendum. Responding party shall be considered the prevailing party should the complaining party be awarded less than seventy-five percent (75%) of complainant's claimed damages.

The appealing party shall pay all fees and costs of such panel. If the appealing party does not prevail, it will pay the other party's attorneys' fees and costs incurred in responding to the appeal.
