Exhibit 10.15

CONTRACT AGREEMENT

Mobile Iron Ore Fines Project



THIS AGREEMENT is made on this 15th day of January, 2013 by and between Metawise Group, Inc., an California corporation (“Metawise”) having its registered office at 1065 E. Hillsdale Blvd., Suite 318, Foster City, CA 94404, U.S.A. and Metamining Nevada Inc., an Nevada corporation (“Metamining Nevada”) having its registered office at 502 North Division Street, Carson City, NV 89703, U.S.A.



WITNESSETH:



WHEREAS, Metawise now owns the right to a total of approximately 5,000,000 metric ton of iron ore fines (IOF) stockpiled near Mobile, Alabama. The former Tronox Facility (formerly Kerr McGee) is a former ore beneficiation plant in the vicinity of 7300 Range Line Road in Theodore, Alabama. IOF were generated during titanium dioxide processing and were disposed of in a landfill and two impoundments at the former Tronox Facility. As a part of the Tronox bankruptcy settlement agreement, the Site and several other Tronox properties were transferred to the Multistate Environmental Response Trust. The Theodore Site is now managed by Greenfield Environmental Multistate Trust, LLC, Trustee of the Multistate Environmental Response Trust (the MST). The MST entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Metawise to remove material from the landfill and impoundments.



WHEREAS, the material has an iron content of 62%, and 25% moisture. Metawise is now in a position to de-water the iron ore to 10% moisture the specifications below and begin shipping approximately 55,000 mts in the second quarter of 2013 and ramping up to approximately 165,000 per month before the end of 2013 (three vessels of 55,000mts) with total shipments projected to be approximately 5,000,000mts. The  specifications form is attached as APPENDIX A.



WHEREAS, Dewatering: Since the bottom of the impoundments are protected by liners to prevent water from going into the soil. Storm water over the years was gathered in the impoundments which makes the moisture of the material higher than usual. Metawise is planning to run the material through filter presses (dewatering machine) to bring down the moisture level. The past expenditures form is attached as APPENDIX B.



WHEREAS, the Materials Management and Shipping Plan (MMSP) had been approved by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) in July, 2011 and in July, 2012 (the revised plan with dewatering equipments), and the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) in June, 2012, which means Metawise has had the full authorization to commence the activities mentioned above on site.



WHEREAS, the production site is being constructed and is expected to be finished in 30 days from now. Then a trial test for another 30 days will be implemented. Final Site activities and project closeout will take an estimated 60 days. Up to now, the three ponds used for recycling the water are ready. And a small pilot test had been finished to prove that the result was as expected. By the end of Febuary, the foundation/concrete pad will be ready, into the middle of March all equipment will be hooked up and ready for the final trial run.



WHEREAS, Metawise Group has entered into Purchase and Sale Agreements with several powerful Chinese steel mills and trading groups, including First Space Holding, Minmetals Group, Wisco and Baosteel.



WHEREAS, Metawise is intended to transfer to Metamining Nevada the exclusive rights of management, operation and resell of approximate 5 million tons or all of the iron ores at the facility in Mobile, Alabama.



NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Metawise and Metamining Nevada agree that the above recitals are true and correct after set forth, both parties agree as follows:
