5.8       Records Retention; Audit. 

(a)        Records Retention.  Commencing as of the date of First Commercial Sale of the first Licensed Product, Bayer and its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall keep for at least [***] years from [***] complete and accurate records of sales by Bayer or its Affiliates or Sublicensees, as the case may be, of each Licensed Product, in sufficient detail to allow the accuracy of the royalties to be confirmed.  For purposes of facilitating ImmunoGen’s audit rights under Section 5.8(b), one complete and accurate set of such records shall be maintained at all times in the United States. 

(b)        Audit.  Subject to the other terms of this Section 5.8(b), at the request of ImmunoGen, upon at least [***] days’ prior written notice, but no more often than [***], and at its sole expense (except as otherwise provided herein), Bayer shall permit an independent certified public accountant reasonably selected by ImmunoGen and reasonably acceptable to Bayer to inspect (during regular business hours) the relevant records required to be maintained by Bayer under Section 5.8(a) in the United States.  At ImmunoGen’s request, the accountant shall be entitled to audit the [***] years of Bayer’s records for purposes of verifying Bayer’s royalty calculations.  To the extent requested by Bayer, the accountant shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with both Parties substantially similar to the provisions of Section 6 limiting the disclosure and use of such information by such accountant to authorized representatives of the Parties and the purposes germane to this Section 5.8.  Results of any such audit shall be made available to both Parties and shall be binding on both Parties.  ImmunoGen agrees to treat the results of any such accountant’s review of Bayer’s records under this Section 5.8(b) as Confidential Information of Bayer subject to the terms of Section 6.  If any such audit reveals a deficiency in the calculation of royalties resulting from any underpayment by Bayer, Bayer shall [***] pay ImmunoGen the amount remaining to be paid [***], and if such underpayment is by [***], Bayer shall pay the costs and expenses of the audit.

11.10   Interpretation.  The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that: (a) each Party and its counsel reviewed and negotiated the terms and provisions of this Agreement and have contributed to its revision; (b) the rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are resolved against the drafting Party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement; and (c) the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be construed fairly as to each Party hereto and not in a favor of or against any Party, regardless of which Party was generally responsible for the preparation of this Agreement.  In addition, unless the context otherwise requires, wherever used, the singular shall include the plural, the plural the singular, the use of any gender shall be applicable to all genders and the word “or” is used in the inclusive sense (and/or). 

11.11   Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction, or declared under any law, rule or regulation of any government having jurisdiction over the Parties hereto, to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, then such provision will, to the extent permitted by the court or government, not be voided, but will instead be construed to give effect to the intentions of the Parties to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.
